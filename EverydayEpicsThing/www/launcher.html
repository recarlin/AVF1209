				<p><strong>What types of native features (on Android and iOS devices) would you be able to implement with the use of HTML/CSS/JS only?</strong></br>
				Phone gap covers many native features for Android and iOS devices. Accelerometer, Camera, Compass, Contacts, File, Geolocation, Media, Network, Notifications, and Storage features are all supported and accessible with HTML/CSS/JS only.</p>
				
				<p><strong>For your CRUD app revision and/or Demo App components, which of these do you think you will implement?</strong></br>
				I plan on using the camera as the backbone of my app. From there I, hopefully, be able to save the images created to the devices, utilizing the native file system. Also, I would like to use the geolocation feature to display where the picture was taken from.</p>
				
				<p><strong>Briefly describe some past 'lessons learned' regarding workflow as it relates to research, design, development, etc.</strong></br>
				Reading everything, planning things out, and working one step at a time are things that I’ve learned help a lot. Missing an important step is always a frustrating situation when you spend a lot of time on trying to figure it out. Jumping straight into a project without any forethought is a terrible idea and will drive you insane. Finally, breaking a big problem into small ones, then working at them one at a time, is a great way to getting over a big hurdle.</p>
				
				<p><strong>Please describe any design intentions you may have for the AVF Demo app and the revised/new version of your CRUD app.</strong></br>
				For my new app I plan on making a fun app that allows you to take pictures of whatever you want and turn it into an item in a game. You then can add “stats” to the item details, like +5 Cold Resistance for a sweater. The app will then display where the item was found, using geolocation. At least this is what I’m planning for it to do.</p>

				<p><strong>What are some of the ways that you could change your HTML on your Demo app to be more accessible?</strong></br>
				I have alt tags on my images, descriptive titles, and such, but if I was making sure that people could use a screen reader, I could do better with that. You really need to be very descriptive for it to work well; it really depends on the developer. I would also try and move my elements on the page to be more available. My back links and some images may be difficult to find, see, or click.</p>
				
				<p><strong>What are some of the common frustrations (or common support mechanisms) that you see among the examples that are given - how could you fix them (or use them)?</strong></br>
				Using very elaborate layouts, multiple elements, and basically cluttering your pages would be an issue. They have to go through the elements on the page one at a time, and if there were a ton of them, it would take all day to navigate. Having a simple and descriptive site would make the software easy to use and not constantly saying things to the users. The one system for the ‘Shine Reader’ is very good, as it makes buttons as big as the entire screen. This would greatly help people that are hard of seeing.</p>
				
				<p><strong>Please list two devices (and some of their features) that are made specifically to support Accessibility.</strong></br>
				Two devices that have many features to support accessibility are our very own iPad and the ‘Shine Reader’. The iPad has options like zoom, large text, VoiceOver, white text on black, speech to text, audio balancing, and AssistiveTouch. All of these features are to help people with vision, hearing, and motor disabilities. For the ‘Shine Reader’, it is a transparent screen that uses finger referencing and splitting the screen into regions to allow users to navigate their device, even with no vision.</p>
				
				<p><strong>Mobile Apps: Please list two apps (either Android or iOS, or both) that are made specifically to support Accessibility.</strong></br>
				The ‘Lexmark Accessibility Solution’ software allows users to operate Lexmark copy machines and other office devices with their iPhone, iPad, or other mobile devices. The ‘Abilipad’ app for iPad turns the iPad into a device specifically tailored to kids with special needs. The application features text-to-speech, a customizable keypad, and word prediction to help children with disabilities learn.</p>
